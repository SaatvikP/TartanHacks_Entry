[INTRO: Upbeat music plays softly in the background]

**Ed Sheeran:** (smiling at the camera) Hey everyone, it’s me, Ed! You know, when I’m not on stage or writing songs, I love to create... whether it’s a doodle, a note, or even the lyrics to my next hit!

[Scene shifts to Ed sitting at a cozy desk, scribbling with a Pen.]

**Ed Sheeran:** That’s why I use Pen! It’s not just any pen; it glides like a smooth melody on paper. Seriously, it makes every word feel special.

[Cut to close-ups of Ed writing and doodling with different colors.]

**Ed Sheeran:** (playfully) And with all these colors, I can express myself just like my music. From deep blues to bright yellows, I'm all about that vibe!

[Scene changes to Ed throwing a few pens in a backpack with a grin.]

**Ed Sheeran:** Plus, it's super handy for, you know, the spontaneous jam sessions or writing in my notebook when inspiration strikes!

[Back to Ed at the desk, now looking directly at the camera.]

**Ed Sheeran:** So, why not add a little magic to your writing? Grab a Pen and let your creativity flow! 

[OUTRO: Logo of the Pen brand appears with the tagline “Write Your Own Story.”]

**Ed Sheeran:** (giving a thumbs up) Trust me, it’s the best companion for every artist!
